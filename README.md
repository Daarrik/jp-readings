My Hello World app for the React framework.
Guess the reading of the Japanese word on the screen with either your Keyboard or the boxes for characters.
(Currently very difficult, even for Japanese native speakers because of irregular readings. Looking for a different API for more common words)

```
npm install -> npm start
```
